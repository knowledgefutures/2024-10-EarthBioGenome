# Questions

- Are genomes or genomeNotes associated with a Project? Could different people/projects produce different notes for the same genome? Or would those somehow collaboratively build a single note?
- Where does the lineage come from? Lookup in NCBI?
- Projects show all genomeNotes of their members? Can one genomeNote be a part of two different projects?
  - If so, we would get rid of the ProjectGenomeNote type and data, and just pull in content by going Project > Member > Contributor > Genome
